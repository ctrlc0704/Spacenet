# SpaceNet: Explainable Deep Learning for Space Tourism Demand Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of **SpaceNet**, a deep learning framework for modeling and predicting space tourism demand, following the methodology described in our research paper.

The pipeline integrates:
- Advanced data preprocessing (outlier removal, normalization, class balancing)
- Feature selection
- Deep neural network modeling
- Cross-validation
- Explainable AI (SHAP)
- Robust evaluation with ROC curves and confusion matrices
